COMP 340 Project 2

To compile:
	make all
To run, type
	./program2
followed by an input file. There are several included to choose from.
For example:

	make all
	./program2 fp2.txt

Then, view:
	out.txt
to see the results for each input file separately. The program always (over)writes to that file.
