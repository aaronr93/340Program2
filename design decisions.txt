Design Decisions

There were several significant design decisions we made:

1. Threading: We decided not to use threads for our implementation. We decided it would be easier to simulate multiple threads, although that may not have actually been the case looking back. Regardless, it helped significantly in learning how the algorithms would function on multiple cores to simulate it without threads, since we had to simulate the cores ourselves.

2. File organization: Rather than defining everything in one document, which would work, we split up the different scheduler functions into different files. It made it much easier to simultaneously work on coding, as well as much easier to debug.

3. Structs: We wanted to have some abstraction to all the information we're dealing with, which includes file input and output. Having dynamic arrays of structs allowed us to easily keep track of information.

3a. Constructors and Destructors: We tried to make our structs act like classes to eliminate (some) overhead from the functions.
